# How to Interact with the RPC Server

Last Modified: 28-May-2025

There are 2 primary ways to interact with the node, using the RPC Server, and using the Asset Server. This document will focus on the RPC Server. The RPC server provides a JSON-RPC interface for interacting with the node. Below is a list of implemented RPC methods with their parameters and return values.

## Teranode RPC HTTP API

The Teranode RPC server provides a JSON-RPC interface for interacting with the node. Below is a list of implemented RPC methods:

### Block-related Methods

1. `getbestblockhash`: Returns the hash of the best (tip) block
2. `getblock`: Retrieves a block by its hash
3. `getblockbyheight`: Retrieves a block by its height
4. `getblockhash`: Returns the hash of a block at specified height
5. `getblockheader`: Returns information about a block's header
6. `getblockchaininfo`: Returns information about the blockchain (available via RPC only, see example below)
7. `invalidateblock`: Marks a block as invalid
8. `reconsiderblock`: Removes invalidity status of a block (performs full block validation)

> **Note:** The `getblockchaininfo` RPC method is accessed via JSON-RPC, not via `teranode-cli`. For a visual view of blockchain state, use the blockchain viewer at <http://localhost:8090/viewer>

### Mining-related Methods

        - `lastrecv`: Time since last message received from this peer
        - `bytessent`: Total bytes sent to this peer

        - `startingheight`: Starting height of the peer
        - `banscore`: Ban score (for misbehavior)

4. `setban`: Manages banned IP addresses/subnets
    - Parameters:

        - `command` (string, required): 'add' to add to banlist, 'remove' to remove from banlist
        - `bantime` (numeric, optional): Time in seconds how long to ban (0 = permanently)

        - `subnet` (string, required): The IP/Subnet to check

    - Returns: Boolean `true` if the address is banned, `false` otherwise

    - Returns: String 'bsvd stopping.' when successful

2. `version`: Returns version information about the node
    - Parameters:
        None

    - Returns: Object containing version information including:

        - `version`: The server version
        - `subversion`: The server subversion string
        - `protocolversion`: The protocol version
        - `localservices`: The services supported by this node
        - `localrelay`: Whether transaction relay is active
        - `timeoffset`: The time offset
        - `buildinfo`: Additional build information (compiler, OS, etc.)

### Error Handling

When an error occurs during RPC method execution, the server returns a standardized error response in the following format:

```json
{
    "result": null,
    "error": {
        "code": -32601,
        "message": "Method not found"
    },
    "id": "1"
}
```

Common error codes include:

- `-32600`: Invalid request
- `-32601`: Method not found
- `-32602`: Invalid parameters
- `-32603`: Internal error
- `-1`: Misc error
- `-2`: Request rejected (e.g., node not synced)
- `-5`: Invalid address or key
- `-8`: Out of memory
- `-32`: Server error (e.g., shutting down)

**Note:** Teranode implements a subset of Bitcoin Core's RPC methods. If you encounter a "Command unimplemented" error, that method is not currently supported. See the [RPC reference documentation](../../references/services/rpc_reference.md) for the complete list of supported methods.

## Authentication

The RPC server uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Credentials are configured in the settings (see the section 4.1 for details). There are two levels of access:

1. Admin access: Full access to all RPC methods.
2. Limited access: Access to a subset of RPC methods defined in `rpcLimited`.

### GRPC API Key Authentication

For direct GRPC service access, certain administrative operations require additional API key authentication:

- **Protected Operations**: `BanPeer` and `UnbanPeer` methods in both P2P and Legacy GRPC services
- **Usage**: API key must be included in GRPC requests as metadata with the key `x-api-key`

**Note**: When using RPC commands like `setban` and `isbanned`, the API key authentication is handled automatically by the RPC server. Direct GRPC access requires manual API key inclusion.

## Request Format

Requests should be sent as HTTP POST requests with a JSON-RPC 1.0 or 2.0 formatted body. For example:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "1.0",
    "id": "1",
    "method": "getbestblockhash",
    "params": []
}
```

## Response Format

Responses are JSON objects containing the following fields:

- `result`: The result of the method call (if successful).
- `error`: Error information (if an error occurred).
- `id`: The id of the request.

## Example Request

The default credentials are `bitcoin:bitcoin`. The default credentials can be changed via settings.

```bash
curl --user bitcoin:bitcoin --data-binary '{"jsonrpc":"1.0","id":"curltext","method":"version","params":[]}' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://localhost:9292/
```

For detailed information on each method's parameters and return values, refer to the Bitcoin SV protocol documentation or the specific Teranode [RPC Reference](../../references/services/rpc_reference.md).
