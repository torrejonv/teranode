## 1. Introduction

> **Note**: For information about how the RPC service is initialized during daemon startup and how it interacts with other services, see the [Teranode Daemon Reference](../../references/teranodeDaemonReference.md#service-initialization-flow).

The RPC server provides compatibility with the Bitcoin RPC interface, allowing clients to interact with the Teranode node using standard Bitcoin RPC commands. The RPC server listens for incoming requests and processes them, returning the appropriate responses.

Teranode provides partial support, as required for its own services. Additional support for specific commands and features might be added over time.

The below table summarises the services supported in the current version:

### Command help

A description of the commands can be found in the `rpcserverhelp.go` file in the `bsvd` repository:

- [rpcserverhelp.go](https://github.com/bitcoinsv/bsvd/blob/master/rpcserverhelp.go)

Teranode RPC server is designed to be compatible with the Bitcoin RPC interface, as implemented in the `bsvd` repository.

### Authentication

All RPC commands require a valid username and password for authentication. The server listens on a specified port for incoming requests and processes them accordingly. The server could be opened up only for local (within the node) access, or it could be exposed to the public internet, depending on the deployment requirements. In either case, authentication is required to access the RPC server.

#### GRPC API Key Authentication

For GRPC services, certain administrative operations require additional API key authentication. The following methods require an API key:

- **Ban/Unban Operations**: `BanPeer` and `UnbanPeer` methods in both P2P and Legacy services require API key authentication for security.

The API key is configured via the `grpc_admin_api_key` setting. If no API key is provided, the system will automatically generate a random 32-byte API key at startup, which will be logged for reference. The API key must be included in GRPC requests as metadata with the key `x-api-key`.

## 2. Architecture

![RPC_Component_Context_Diagram.png](img/RPC_Component_Context_Diagram.png)

The following diagram provides additional detail showing the RPC Service's internal structure and external service connections:

> **Note**: This diagram shows a simplified component view. The RPC Server handles all JSON-RPC processing, command routing, and service client interactions through the `RPCServer` struct and its handler function map (`rpcHandlers`), rather than having separate handler components for each command category.

![RPC_Component](img/plantuml/rpc/RPC_Component.svg)

The RPC server is a standalone service that listens for incoming requests and processes them based on the command type. The server starts by initializing the HTTP server and setting up the necessary configurations.

It then listens for incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate handler based on the command type. The handler processes the request, executes the command, and returns the response to the client.

In order to serve some of the requests, the RPC server interacts with the Teranode core services to fetch the required data.

For example, when a `getblock` command is received, the server interacts with the blockchain service to fetch the block data.

Also, when a `generate` command is received, the server interacts with the miner service to generate the requested number of blocks.

## 3. Functionality

### 3.1. Command: Create Raw Transaction

The `createrawtransaction` RPC method is used in Bitcoin to manually create a raw transaction. This transaction is not broadcast to the network but returned as a hex-encoded string. The created transaction could then be further modified, signed, and eventually broadcast using other RPC commands.

The CreateRawTransaction method constructs a transaction that spends a given set of inputs and sends the outputs to specified addresses. It requires specific parameters about the inputs (which UTXOs to spend) and outputs (where to send the coins).

![rpc-create-raw-transaction.svg](img/plantuml/rpc/rpc-create-raw-transaction.svg)

#### Input Parameters

- **Inputs**: A list of transaction inputs including the transaction ID (`txid`), output index (`vout`), and a sequence number if applicable.
- **Amounts**: A dictionary where each key is a Bitcoin address and the value is the amount of bitcoin to send to that address.
- **LockTime** (optional): Specifies the earliest time or block number that this transaction can be included in the blockchain.

#### Steps

1. **Validate LockTime**: Checks if the provided `LockTime` is within the valid range.

2. **Create Transaction**: Initializes a new transaction (`mtx`).

3. **Process Inputs**:

    - For each input, it validates the transaction ID and constructs the transaction input structure.
    - If a `LockTime` is set and not zero, it adjusts the sequence number to allow for the lock time to be effective.

4. **Process Outputs**:

    - Validates the amount for each output to ensure it's within the valid monetary range.
    - Validates each output address, ensuring it's a supported type and appropriate for the network.
    - Creates a payment script for each address and constructs the transaction output.

5. **Set Transaction LockTime**: If provided, sets the transaction's lock time.

6. **Serialize Transaction**: Converts the transaction to a hex-encoded string for output.

#### Outputs

- **Success**: Returns a hex-encoded string representing the raw transaction.
- **Error**: Returns an error if there are issues with the inputs, outputs, lock time, address decoding, or serialization.

### 3.2. Command: Freeze

The `freeze` command allows administrators to freeze a specific UTXO, preventing it from being spent in future transactions.

#### Function Overview

- **Purpose**: To mark a specific transaction output (UTXO) as frozen, making it unavailable for spending

- **Parameters**:

    - `txid` (string, required): The transaction ID of the output to freeze
    - `vout` (numeric, required): The output index to freeze

- **Return Value**:

    - On success: Returns `true` indicating the UTXO was successfully frozen
    - On failure: Returns an error if the UTXO cannot be found or frozen

#### Process Flow

![rpc-freeze.svg](img/plantuml/rpc/rpc-freeze.svg)

1. **Request Processing**:

    - Receives request with transaction ID and output index
    - Validates input parameters
    - Initializes tracing and metrics

2. **UTXO Validation**:

    - Checks if the specified UTXO exists
    - Validates that the UTXO is not already frozen

3. **Freezing Operation**:

    - Marks the UTXO as frozen in the UTXO state database
    - Records the freezing action for auditing purposes

4. **Response Construction**:

    - Returns `true` on successful freeze operation
    - Returns error if validation fails or database update fails

#### (Success) Response Fields

- Returns boolean `true` on successful freeze operation

#### Important Notes

- Freezing a UTXO is an administrative function that should be used with caution
- This operation is reversible using the `unfreeze` command
- Frozen UTXOs will be rejected if included in transaction inputs

### 3.3. Command: Generate

The `generate` command is used to generate a specified number of blocks on the blockchain. The RPC server processes this command by interacting with the blockchain service to create the requested number of blocks.

This command is commonly used in testing and development environments to artificially advance the blockchain by generating blocks immediately, rather than waiting for them to be mined in the usual way.

![rpc-generate.svg](img/plantuml/rpc/rpc-generate.svg)

The function accepts a `GenerateCmd` which contains the number of blocks to generate, and sends an HTTP GET request to the miner's URL (e.g. `http://localhost:${MINER_HTTP_PORT}/mine?blocks=${numberOfBlocksToGenerate}`) to trigger block generation.

- **Example Use**:

```go
// Sample usage within an RPC server setup
command := &bsvjson.GenerateCmd{NumBlocks: 10}
result, err := handleGenerate(rpcServerInstance, command, closeChannel)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to generate blocks: %v", err)
}
```

- **Settings**: It requires a valid `MINER_HTTP_PORT` setting.

- **Considerations:**

    - This function should not be exposed in production environments as it allows the generation of blocks outside of the normal consensus rules, which can be exploited or lead to unintended forks if used maliciously.
    - Ensure the miner service is secured and only accessible by the RPC server to prevent unauthorized block generation.

#### (Success) Response Fields

- Returns nil on success

### 3.4. Command: Generate to Address

The `generatetoaddress` command mines blocks immediately to a specified address. This command is primarily used for testing purposes.

#### Function Overview

- **Purpose**: To generate a specified number of blocks with coinbase rewards sent to a designated address

- **Parameters**:

    - `nblocks` (numeric, required): Number of blocks to generate
    - `address` (string, required): The address to send the newly generated bitcoin to
    - `maxtries` (numeric, optional): Maximum number of iterations to try

- **Return Value**:

    - On success: Returns an array of block hashes that were generated
    - On failure: Returns an error describing what went wrong

#### Process Flow

![rpc-generate-to-address.svg](img/plantuml/rpc/rpc-generate-to-address.svg)

1. **Request Processing**:

    - Receives request with number of blocks, destination address, and optional max tries
    - Validates input parameters
    - Initializes tracing and metrics

2. **Address Validation**:

    - Validates the destination address format and network compatibility
    - Creates a payment script for the address

3. **Block Generation Setup**:

    - Prepares the mining configuration with the specified address
    - Sets up the maximum number of hash attempts (tries)

4. **Block Generation Loop**:

    - For each requested block:

        - Creates a new block template with the address script
        - Performs proof-of-work calculation
        - Processes and validates the new block
        - Adds the block to the blockchain

5. **Response Construction**:

    - Collects the hashes of all successfully generated blocks
    - Returns the array of block hashes

#### (Success) Response Fields

- Returns an array of strings, each containing the hex-encoded hash of a generated block

#### Important Notes

- This command is for testing purposes only and should not be used in production environments
- It bypasses normal mining difficulty by forcing block creation
- Can be used to test blockchain functionality or advance the chain state rapidly for testing
- All generated blocks will send the block reward to the specified address

### 3.5. Command: Get Best Block Hash

The `getbestblockhash` command is used to retrieve the hash of the best (most recent) block on the blockchain. The RPC server processes this command by interacting with the blockchain service to fetch the hash of the best block.

![rpc-get-best-block-height.svg](img/plantuml/rpc/rpc-get-best-block-height.svg)

#### (Success) Response Fields

- **hash**: The hex-encoded hash of the best block in the main chain

### 3.6. Command: Get Block

The `getblock` command is used to retrieve information about a specific block on the blockchain. The RPC server processes this command by interacting with the blockchain service to fetch the block data based on the provided block hash.

![rpc-get-block.svg](img/plantuml/rpc/rpc-get-block.svg)

#### (Success) Response Fields

When verbosity=0:

- Returns hex-encoded serialized block data

### 3.7. Command: Get Block By Height

The `getblockbyheight` command returns information about a block at a specific height in the blockchain. The response format varies based on the verbosity parameter.

#### Function Overview

- **Purpose**: To retrieve block information using block height instead of block hash

- **Parameters**:

    - `height`: The height of the block to retrieve
    - `verbosity`: Determines the format and detail level of the returned data
        - 0: Returns serialized, hex-encoded block data

![rpc-unfreeze.svg](img/plantuml/rpc/rpc-unfreeze.svg)

1. **Request Processing**:

    - Receives request with transaction ID and output index
    - Validates input parameters
    - Initializes tracing and metrics

2. **UTXO Validation**:

    - Checks if the specified UTXO exists
    - Validates that the UTXO is currently frozen

3. **Unfreezing Operation**:

    - Removes the frozen status from the UTXO in the state database
    - Records the unfreezing action for auditing purposes

4. **Response Construction**:

    - Returns `true` on successful unfreeze operation
    - Returns error if validation fails or database update fails

#### (Success) Response Fields

- Returns boolean `true` on successful unfreeze operation

#### Important Notes

- Only previously frozen UTXOs can be unfrozen
- After unfreezing, the UTXO becomes available for spending in transactions
- This operation is an administrative function that should be used with appropriate authorization

### 3.26. Command: Version

The `version` command is used to retrieve the version information of the RPC server. The RPC server processes this command by constructing a response with the server version information and returning it to the client.

#### (Success) Response Fields

- **btcdjsonrpcapi**: Object containing version information
    - **versionString**: Semantic version string
    - **major**: Major version number
    - **minor**: Minor version number
    - **patch**: Patch version number

## 4. Technology

### **HTTP Server and RESTful API**

- **Usage**: In `Server.go`, an HTTP server is set up to listen for requests and send responses.
- **Functionality**: Handling HTTP requests and responses, as well as routing, middleware support.

### **Authentication and Security**

- **Basic Authentication**: Handling basic HTTP authentication to secure server access.

## 5. Directory Structure and Main Files

The RPC service is located in the `services/rpc` directory. The main files and directories are as follows:

```text
./services/rpc
├── Server.go          # Main server application file: Initializes and runs the server, sets up configurations, and handles lifecycle events.
└── handlers.go        # Request handlers: Defines functions that process incoming requests based on type and content.
```

## 6. Configuration Settings

For comprehensive configuration documentation including all settings, defaults, and interactions, see the [rpc Settings Reference](../../references/settings/services/rpc_settings.md).

## 7. How to run

To run the RPC Service locally, you can execute the following command:

```shell
SETTINGS_CONTEXT=dev.[YOUR_CONTEXT] go run . -rpc=1
```

Please refer to the [Locally Running Services Documentation](../../howto/locallyRunningServices.md) document for more information on running the RPC Service locally.
