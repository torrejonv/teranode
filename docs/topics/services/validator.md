## 1. Description

The `Validator` (also called `Transaction Validator` or `Tx Validator`) is a go component responsible for:

1. Receiving new transactions from the `Propagation`service,
2. Validating them,
3. Persisting the data into the utxo store,
4. Propagating the transactions to other services based on validation results:

    - **Block Assembly service**: Direct gRPC calls for validated transactions (if the Tx is passed)
    - **Subtree Validation service**: Kafka topic for transaction metadata (if the Tx is passed)
    - **P2P service**: Kafka topic for rejected transaction notifications (if the tx is rejected)

### 1.1 Deployment Models

The Validator can be deployed in two distinct ways:

1. **Local Validator (Recommended)**:

    - The Validator is instantiated directly within other services (like the Propagation, Subtree Validation, and Legacy Services)
    - This is the recommended approach for production deployments due to better performance
    - No additional network calls are needed between services and validator
    - Configuration: Set `validator.useLocalValidator=true` in your settings

2. **Remote Validator Service**:

    - The Validator runs as an independent service with a gRPC interface
    - Other services connect to it remotely via gRPC
    - This approach has higher latency due to additional network calls
    - Useful for development, testing, or specialized deployment scenarios
    - Configuration: Set `validator.useLocalValidator=false` and configure validator gRPC endpoint

The performance difference between these approaches can be significant, as the local validator approach eliminates network overhead between services.

> **Note**: For detailed information about how the daemon initializes services and manages dependencies, see the [Teranode Daemon Reference](../../references/teranodeDaemonReference.md#service-initialization-flow).

![Tx_Validator_Container_Diagram.png](img/Tx_Validator_Container_Diagram.png)

The Validator, as a component, is instantiated as part of any service requiring to validate transactions.
However, the Validator can also be started as a service, allowing to interact with it via gRPC or Kafka. This setup is not recommended, given its performance overhead.

The Validator receives notifications about new Txs.

Also, the `Validator` will accept subscriptions from the P2P Service, where rejected tx notifications are pushed to.

![Tx_Validator_Component_Diagram.png](img/Tx_Validator_Component_Diagram.png)

### Detailed Component Diagram

The detailed component diagram below shows the internal architecture of the Validator when deployed as a **Remote Validator Service** (with gRPC and HTTP servers).

> **Important**: This diagram represents the Remote Validator Service deployment model. In the recommended **Local Validator** deployment (see section 1.1), the gRPC and HTTP servers are not present, and the validator is instantiated directly within calling services for better performance.

![Validator_Component](img/plantuml/validator/Validator_Component.svg)

The Validator notifies the Block Assembly service of new transactions through gRPC calls via the Block Assembly client interface.

A node can start multiple parallel instances of the TX Validator. This translates into multiple pods within a Kubernetes cluster. Each instance / pod will have its own gRPC server, and will be able to receive and process transactions independently. GRPC load balancing allows to distribute the load across the multiple instances.

### Kafka Integration

The Validator uses Kafka for several critical messaging paths:

1. **Transaction Metadata Publishing**:

    - Successfully validated transactions have their metadata published to a Kafka topic
    - Metadata includes transaction ID, size, fee, input and output information
    - The `txmetaKafkaProducerClient` handles this publishing process
    - Target topic is configured via `Kafka.TxMetaConfig` settings

2. **Rejected Transaction Notifications**:

    - When transactions fail validation, details are published to a rejection topic
    - The `rejectedTxKafkaProducerClient` is responsible for these messages
    - Includes rejection reason, transaction ID, and error classification
    - Helps with network-wide tracking of invalid transactions

3. **Transaction Validation Requests**:

    - The Validator can also consume validation requests via Kafka
    - This enables asynchronous transaction processing patterns
    - Useful for high-throughput scenarios where immediate responses aren't needed

The Kafka integration provides resilience, allowing the system to handle temporary outages or service unavailability by buffering messages.

### Communication Patterns Summary

The Validator uses different communication patterns depending on the target service and use case:

**Outbound Communications (Validator → Other Services):**

- **Block Assembly**: gRPC calls via `blockassembly.ClientI` interface - used for real-time transaction forwarding to mining candidates
- **Subtree Validation**: Kafka producer via `txmetaKafkaProducerClient` - used for transaction metadata publishing
- **P2P Service**: Kafka producer via `rejectedTxKafkaProducerClient` - used for rejected transaction notifications

**Inbound Communications (Other Services → Validator):**

- **Propagation Service**: Direct method calls (local validator) or gRPC calls (remote validator)
- **Subtree Validation Service**: Direct method calls (local validator) or gRPC calls (remote validator)
- **Kafka Consumers**: Kafka messages via `consumerClient` - used for asynchronous validation requests
- **HTTP API**: REST endpoints for external validation requests

The choice between local method calls and gRPC depends on the deployment model configured via the `useLocalValidator` setting.

## 2. Functionality

### 2.1. Starting the Validator as a service

Should the node require to start the validator as an independent service, the `services/validator/Server.go` will be instantiated as follows:

![tx_validator_init.svg](img/plantuml/validator/tx_validator_init.svg)

- **`NewServer` Function**:

    1. Initialize a new `Server` instance.
    2. Create channels for new and dead subscriptions.
    3. Initialize a map for subscribers.
    4. Create a context for subscriptions and a corresponding cancellation function.
    5. Return the newly created `Server` instance.

- **`Init` Function**:
    1. Create a new validator instance within the server.
    2. Handle any errors during the creation of the validator.
    3. Return the outcome (success or error).

- **`Start` Function**:
    1. Start a goroutine to manage new and dead subscriptions.
    2. Start the gRPC server and handle any errors.

### 2.2. Receiving Transaction Validation Requests

The Propagation and Subtree Validation modules invoke the validator process in order to have new or previously missed Txs validated. The Propagation service is responsible for processing new Txs, while the Block Validation service is responsible for identifying missed Txs while processing blocks.

![tx_validation_request_process.svg](img/plantuml/validator/tx_validation_request_process.svg)

BlockValidation and Propagation invoke the validator process with and without batching. Batching is settings controlled, and improves the processing performance.

1. **Transaction Propagation**:

    - The Propagation module `ProcessTransaction()` function invokes `Validate()` on the Validator client.
    - The Validator validates the transaction.

2. **Subtree Validation**:

    - The SubtreeValidation module `blessMissingTransaction()` function invokes `Validate()` on the Validator client.
    - The Validator validates the transaction.

### 2.3. Validating the Transaction

For every transaction received, Teranode must validate:

- All inputs against the existing UTXO-set, verifying if the input(s) can be spent,
    - Notice that if Teranode detects a double-spend, the transaction that was received first must be considered the valid transaction.
- Bitcoin consensus rules,
- Local policies (if any),
- Whether the script execution returns `true`.

Teranode will consider a transaction that passes consensus rules, local policies and script validation as fully validated and fit to be included in the next possible block.

The validation process includes several stages:

1. **Basic Transaction Structure Validation**:

    - Verify inputs and outputs are present
    - Check transaction size against policy limits
    - Validate input and output value ranges

2. **Policy Validation**:

    - Apply configurable policy rules that can be enabled/disabled
    - Check transaction fees against minimum requirements
    - Enforce limits on script operations (sigops)

3. **Input Validation**:

    - Verify inputs exist in the UTXO set
    - Ensure inputs are unspent (prevent double-spending)
    - Validate input script format

New Txs are validated by the `ValidateTransaction()` function. To ensure the validity of the extended Tx, this is delegated to a BSV library: `github.com/TAAL-GmbH/arc/validator/default` (the default validator).

We can see the exact steps being executed as part of the validation process below:

```go
func (tv *TxValidator) ValidateTransaction(tx *bt.Tx, blockHeight uint32, validationOptions *Options) error {
 //
 // Each node will verify every transaction against a long checklist of criteria:
 //
 txSize := tx.Size()

 // 1) Neither lists of inputs nor outputs are empty
 if len(tx.Inputs) == 0 || len(tx.Outputs) == 0 {
  return errors.NewTxInvalidError("transaction has no inputs or outputs")
 }

 // 2) The transaction size in bytes is less than maxtxsizepolicy.
 if !validationOptions.SkipPolicyChecks {
  if err := tv.checkTxSize(txSize); err != nil {
   return err
  }
 }

 // 3) check that each input value, as well as the sum, are in the allowed range of values (less than 21m coins)
 // 5) None of the inputs have hash=0, N=–1 (coinbase transactions should not be relayed)
 if err := tv.checkInputs(tx, blockHeight); err != nil {
  return err
 }

 // 4) Each output value, as well as the total, must be within the allowed range of values (less than 21m coins,
 //    more than the dust threshold if 1 unless it's OP_RETURN, which is allowed to be 0)
 if err := tv.checkOutputs(tx, blockHeight); err != nil {
  return err
 }

 // The transaction size in bytes is greater than or equal to 100 (BCH only check, not applicable to BSV)

 // The number of signature operations (SIGOPS) contained in the transaction is less than the signature operation limit
 // Note: This may be disabled for unlimited operation counts

 // The unlocking script (scriptSig) can only push numbers on the stack
 if tv.interpreter.Interpreter() != TxInterpreterGoBDK && blockHeight > tv.settings.ChainCfgParams.UahfForkHeight {
  if err := tv.pushDataCheck(tx); err != nil {
   return err
  }
 }

 // 10) Reject if the sum of input values is less than sum of output values
 // 11) Reject if transaction fee would be too low (minRelayTxFee) to get into an empty block.
 if !validationOptions.SkipPolicyChecks {
  if err := tv.checkFees(tx, feesToBtFeeQuote(tv.settings.Policy.GetMinMiningTxFee())); err != nil {
   return err
  }
 }

 // 12) The unlocking scripts for each input must validate against the corresponding output locking scripts
 // (Script verification is handled separately with multiple interpreter options)

 return nil
}
```

The above represents an implementation of the core Teranode validation rules:

- All transactions must exist and be unspent (does not apply to Coinbase transactions).

- All transaction inputs must have been present in either a transaction in an ancestor block, or in a transaction in the same block that is located before the transaction being validated.

- All transaction inputs must not have been spent by any transaction in ancestor blocks, or by any transaction in the same block that is not located after the transaction being validated

- The length of the script (scriptSig) in the Coinbase transaction must be between 2 and (including) 100 bytes.

- The transaction must be syntactically valid:

- A transaction must have at least one input

- A transaction must have at least one output

- The amount of satoshis in all outputs must be less than or equal to the amount of satoshis in the inputs, to avoid new BSV being introduced to the network

- The amount in all outputs must be between 0 and 21,000,000 BSV (2.1 * 10^15 satoshi)

- The amount of all inputs must be between 0 and 21,000,000 BSV. The sum of the amount over all inputs must not be larger than 21,000,000 BSV.

- A transaction must be final, meaning that either of the following conditions is met:

    - The sequence number in all inputs is equal to 0xffffffff, or

    - The lock time is:

    - Equal to zero, or

    - <500000000 and smaller than block height, or >=500000000 and SMALLER THAN TIMESTAMP

        - Note: This means that Teranode will deem non-final transactions invalid and REJECT these transactions. It is up to the user to create proper non-final transactions to ensure that Teranode is aware of them. For clarity, if a transaction has a locktime in the future, the Tx Validator will reject it.

    - No output must be Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH)

    - A new transaction must not have any output which includes P2SH, as creation of new P2SH transactions is not allowed.

    - Historical P2SH transactions (if any) must still be supported by Teranode, allowing these transactions to be spent.

    - A transaction must not spend frozen UTXOs (see 3.13 – Integration with Alert System)

    - A node must not be able to spend a confiscated (re-assigned) transaction until 1,000 blocks after the transaction was re-assigned (confiscation maturity). The difference between block height and height at which the transaction was re-assigned must not be less than one thousand.

### 2.3.1. Consensus Rules vs Policy Checks

In Bitcoin transaction validation, there are two distinct types of rules:

1. **Consensus Rules**: Mandatory rules that all nodes must enforce to maintain network consensus. Transactions violating consensus rules are always rejected. These include:

    - Transaction structure and formatting
    - Double-spend prevention
    - Input and output value constraints
    - Script execution validity

2. **Policy Rules**: Node-specific preferences that determine which valid transactions to accept, relay, or mine. Policy rules can differ between nodes without breaking consensus. These include:

    - Minimum transaction fees
    - Maximum transaction size
    - Script complexity limits
    - Dust output thresholds

The TX Validator implements both types of rules, but provides the ability to skip policy checks when appropriate through the `SkipPolicyChecks` option.

#### Skip Policy Checks Feature

The `SkipPolicyChecks` feature allows Teranode to validate transactions while bypassing certain policy-based validations. When enabled, the validator will:

- Skip transaction size policy checks
- Skip minimum fee requirements
- Apply consensus-only script verification rules
- Continue enforcing all consensus rules

This feature is particularly important when validating transactions that:

- Are part of blocks mined by other miners (which have already been validated through proof-of-work)
- Need to be accepted regardless of local policy preferences
- Have already been confirmed on the blockchain

```go
// Example of policy checks being conditionally applied:
if !validationOptions.SkipPolicyChecks {
    if err := tv.checkFees(tx, feesToBtFeeQuote(tv.settings.Policy.GetMinMiningTxFee())); err != nil {
        return err
    }
}
```

When validating transactions from blocks mined by other nodes, policy checks should be skipped because these blocks are already valid due to proof-of-work, and the transactions must be accepted to maintain consensus, even if they don't meet local policy preferences.

#### Skip Policy Checks - Usage

To use this feature:

- When directly calling the validator: Use the `WithSkipPolicyChecks(true)` option
- When using the gRPC API endpoint: Set the `skip_policy_checks` field to `true` in the `ValidateTransactionRequest` message
- In services like Subtree Validation: The option is applied automatically when validating block transactions

### 2.3.2. Transaction Format Extension

The Validator Service automatically handles transaction format conversion during the validation pipeline, enabling support for both standard Bitcoin format and Extended Format (BIP-239) transactions.

#### Extension Process

When a transaction arrives in standard Bitcoin format (non-extended), the validator automatically extends it before validation:

1. **Detection**: The validator checks `tx.IsExtended()` before validation begins
2. **Parent Lookup**: Queries the UTXO store for all parent transactions referenced by the transaction's inputs
3. **Input Decoration**: For each input, the system retrieves and adds:

   ```go
   tx.Inputs[idx].PreviousTxSatoshis = parentTx.Outputs[vout].Satoshis
   tx.Inputs[idx].PreviousTxScript = parentTx.Outputs[vout].LockingScript
   ```

4. **In-Memory Extension**: Transaction is marked as extended (not persisted to storage)
5. **Validation**: Proceeds with full validation using the extended data

This extension process occurs transparently at multiple checkpoints in the validation pipeline:

- `Validator.Validate()` in `services/validator/Validator.go` - Initial format check before validation
- `Validator.validateConsensusRules()` in `services/validator/Validator.go` - Before consensus rule checks
- `Validator.validateScripts()` in `services/validator/Validator.go` - Before script validation

#### Implementation Details

**Key Functions:**

- `getTransactionInputBlockHeightsAndExtendTx()` - Orchestrates the extension process, fetching parent data and decorating inputs
- `getUtxoBlockHeightsAndExtendTx()` - Retrieves block heights and extends transactions in parallel
- `PreviousOutputsDecorate()` - UTXO store method that decorates transaction inputs with previous output data
- `extendTransaction()` - Wrapper function for the extension logic

**Performance Optimization:**

- **Parallel batch queries**: Parent transactions are looked up concurrently using Go's errgroup pattern
- **Configurable batching**: UTXO store queries are batched based on `UtxoStore.GetBatcherSize` setting
- **Idempotent operation**: Already-decorated inputs are skipped automatically
- **In-memory only**: Extension happens entirely in memory with no disk I/O overhead
- **Sub-millisecond lookups**: Highly optimized UTXO store (Aerospike/SQL) combined with txmeta cache provides extremely fast parent transaction retrieval

**Code Example:**

```go
// From Validator.Validate() method
if !tx.IsExtended() {
    // Get block heights and extend the transaction
    if utxoHeights, err = v.getTransactionInputBlockHeightsAndExtendTx(ctx, tx, txID); err != nil {
        return nil, errors.NewProcessingError("[Validate][%s] error getting transaction input block heights", txID, err)
    }
}
```

#### Error Handling

If parent transactions cannot be found during the extension process:

- Returns `ErrTxMissingParent` error to the client
- Transaction validation fails gracefully
- Provides clear error message indicating which parent transaction is missing
- Client can retry after ensuring parent transactions are validated/confirmed

**Common scenarios requiring parent transactions:**

- **Child-pays-for-parent (CPFP)**: Transaction chains where child hasn't been validated yet
- **Concurrent submissions**: Parent and child transactions submitted simultaneously
- **Block validation**: Transactions referencing outputs from the same block being processed

#### Format Flexibility Benefits

This automatic extension mechanism provides several advantages:

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing Bitcoin wallets work without modification
2. **No Client Changes Required**: Wallets can continue using standard Bitcoin transaction format
3. **Optimized When Available**: Extended format transactions skip the lookup step for faster processing
4. **Transparent Operation**: Format handling is invisible to the client
5. **Storage Efficiency**: All transactions stored in non-extended format regardless of ingress format

For more details on transaction format handling across the system, see the [Transaction Data Model documentation](../datamodel/transaction_data_model.md).

### 2.4. Script Verification

The Validator supports multiple script verification implementations through a flexible interpreter architecture. Three different script interpreters are supported:

1. **GoBT Interpreter** (`TxInterpreterGoBT`):

    - Based on the Go-BT library
    - Default interpreter for basic script validation

2. **GoSDK Interpreter** (`TxInterpreterGoSDK`):

    - Based on the Go-SDK library
    - Provides advanced script validation capabilities

3. **GoBDK Interpreter** (`TxInterpreterGoBDK`):

    - Based on the Go-BDK library
    - Optimized for performance in high-throughput scenarios
    - Includes specialized Bitcoin script validation features

The script verification process:

1. Each transaction input's unlocking script is validated against its corresponding output's locking script

2. The interpreter evaluates if the combined script executes successfully and leaves 'true' on the stack

3. The script verification is context-aware, considering current block height and network parameters

Script verification can be configured using the `validator_scriptVerificationLibrary` setting, which defaults to "VerificatorGoBT".

### 2.5. Error Handling and Transaction Rejection

The Validator implements a structured error handling system to categorize and report different types of validation failures:

1. **Error Types**:

    - `TxInvalidError`: Generated when a transaction fails basic validation rules
    - `ProcessingError`: Occurs during transaction processing issues
    - `ConfigurationError`: Indicates validator configuration problems
    - `ServiceError`: Represents broader service-level issues

2. **Rejection Flow**:

    - When a transaction is rejected, detailed error information is captured
    - Rejection reasons are categorized (e.g., invalid inputs, script failure, insufficient fees)
    - Rejected transactions are published to a dedicated Kafka topic if configured
    - The P2P service receives notifications about rejected transactions

3. **Error Propagation**:

    - Errors are wrapped and propagated through the system with context information
    - GRPC error codes translate internal errors for API responses
    - Detailed error messages assist in diagnosing validation issues

### 2.6. Concurrent Processing

The Validator leverages concurrency to optimize transaction processing performance:

1. **Parallel UTXO Saving**:

    - The `saveInParallel` flag enables concurrent UTXO updates
    - Improves throughput by processing multiple transactions simultaneously

2. **Batching**:

    - Transactions can be validated in batches for higher throughput
    - Batch processing is configurable and used by both Propagation and Subtree Validation services
    - The `TriggerBatcher()` method initiates batch processing when sufficient transactions accumulate

3. **Error Group Pattern**:

    - Uses Go's `errgroup` package for coordinated concurrent execution
    - Maintains proper error propagation in concurrent processing flows

4. **Two-Phase Commit Process**:

    - The `twoPhaseCommitTransaction` method ensures atomic transaction processing
    - Prevents partial updates in case of failures during concurrent processing

### 2.7. Post-validation: Updating stores and propagating the transaction

Once a Tx is validated, the Validator will update the UTXO store with the new Tx data. Then, it will notify the Block Assembly service and any P2P subscribers about the new Tx.

![tx_validation_post_process.svg](img/plantuml/validator/tx_validation_post_process.svg)

- The Server receives a validation request and calls the `Validate` method on the Validator struct.
- If the transaction is valid:

    - The Validator marks the transaction's input UTXOs as spent in the UTXO Store.
    - The Validator registers the new transaction in the UTXO Store.
    - The Validator sends transaction metadata to the Subtree Validation Service via Kafka topic (`txmeta`).
    - The Validator sends the transaction to the Block Assembly Service via direct gRPC calls.
    - The Validator stores the new UTXOs generated by the transaction in the UTXO Store.

- If the transaction is invalid:

    - The Server sends invalid transaction notifications to all P2P Service subscribers.
    - The rejected Tx is not stored or tracked in any store, and it is simply discarded.

We can see the submission to the Subtree Validation Service here:

![tx_validation_subtree_validation.svg](img/plantuml/validator/tx_validation_subtree_validation.svg)

We can dive deeper into the submission to the Block Assembly:

![tx_validation_block_assembly.svg](img/plantuml/validator/tx_validation_block_assembly.svg)

The Validator notifies the Block Assembly service of new transactions through gRPC calls via the Block Assembly client interface by calling the `Store()` method on the Block Assembly client.

### Configuration Settings Affecting Validator Behavior

The Validator service behavior is controlled by several key configuration parameters:

- **`KafkaMaxMessageBytes`** (default: 1MB): Controls size-based routing - large transactions that exceed this threshold are routed via HTTP instead of Kafka to avoid message size limitations.
- **`UseLocalValidator`** (default: false): Determines whether to use a local validator instance or connect to a remote validator service via gRPC.
- **`KafkaWorkers`** (default: 0): Controls the number of concurrent Kafka message processing workers. When set to 0, Kafka consumer processing is disabled.
- **`HTTPRateLimit`** (default: 1024): Sets the rate limit for HTTP API requests to prevent service overload.
- **`VerboseDebug`** (default: false): Enables detailed validation logging for troubleshooting.

### Rejected Transaction Handling

When the Transaction Validator Service identifies an invalid transaction, it employs a Kafka-based notification system to inform other components of the system. Here's an overview of this process:

![tx_validation_p2p_subscribers.svg](img/plantuml/validator/tx_validation_p2p_subscribers.svg)

1. **Transaction Validation**:

    - The Validator receives a transaction for validation via a gRPC call to the `ValidateTransaction` method.
    - The Validator performs its checks, including script verification, UTXO spending, and other validation rules.

2. **Identification of Invalid Transactions**:

    - If the transaction fails any of the validation checks, it is deemed invalid (rejected).

3. **Notification of Rejected Transactions**:

    - When a transaction is rejected, the Validator publishes information about the rejected transaction to a dedicated Kafka topic (`rejectedTx`).
    - This is done using the Rejected Tx Kafka Producer, which is configured via the `kafka_rejectedTxConfig` setting.

4. **Kafka Message Content**:

    - The Kafka message for a rejected transaction typically includes:

        - The transaction ID (hash)
        - The reason for rejection (error message)

5. **Consumption of Rejected Transaction Notifications**:

    - Other services in the system, such as the P2P Service, can subscribe to this Kafka topic.
    - By consuming messages from this topic, these services receive notifications about rejected transactions and can take appropriate action (e.g., banning peers that send invalid transactions).

#### 2.7.1. Two-Phase Transaction Commit Process

The Validator implements a two-phase commit process for transaction creation and addition to block assembly:

1. **Phase 1 - Transaction Creation with Locked Flag**:

    - When a transaction is created, it is initially stored in the UTXO store with an "locked" flag set to `true`.
    - This flag prevents the transaction outputs from being spent while it's in the process of being validated and added to block assembly, protecting against potential double-spend attempts.

2. **Phase 2 - Unsetting the Locked Flag**:

    - The locked flag is unset in two key scenarios:

    a. **After Successful Addition to Block Assembly**:

    ```text
    - When a transaction is successfully validated and added to the block assembly, the Validator service immediately unsets the "locked" flag (sets it to `false`).
    - This makes the transaction outputs available for spending in subsequent transactions, even before the transaction is mined in a block.
    ```

    b. **When Mined in a Block (Fallback Mechanism)**:

    ```text
    - As a fallback mechanism, if the flag hasn't been unset already, it will be unset when the transaction is mined in a block.
    - When the transaction is mined in a block and that block is processed by the Block Validation service, the "locked" flag is unset (set to `false`) during the `SetMinedMulti` operation.
    ```

3. **Ignoring Locked Flag for Block Transactions**:

    - When processing transactions that are part of a block (as opposed to new transactions to include in an upcoming block), the validator can be configured to ignore the locked flag.
    - This is necessary because transactions in a block have already been validated by miners and must be accepted regardless of their locked status.
    - The validator uses the `WithIgnoreLocked` option to control this behavior during transaction validation.

This two-phase commit approach ensures that transactions are only made spendable after they've been successfully added to block assembly, reducing the risk of race conditions and double-spend attempts during the transaction processing lifecycle.

> **For a comprehensive explanation of the two-phase commit process across the entire system, see the [Two-Phase Transaction Commit Process](../features/two_phase_commit.md) documentation.**

## 3. gRPC Protobuf Definitions

The Validator, when run as a service, uses gRPC for communication between nodes. The protobuf definitions used for defining the service methods and message formats can be found in the protobuf documentation.

## 4. Data Model

The Validation Service processes transactions in multiple formats:

- [Transaction Data Model](../datamodel/transaction_data_model.md): Comprehensive documentation covering both standard Bitcoin format and Extended Format (BIP-239), including automatic format conversion and storage strategies.

## 5. Technology

The code snippet you've provided utilizes a variety of technologies and libraries, each serving a specific purpose within the context of a Bitcoin SV (BSV) blockchain-related application. Here's a breakdown of these technologies:

1. **Go (Golang)**: The programming language used for the entire codebase.

2. **gRPC**: Google's Remote Procedure Call system, used here for server-client communication. It enables the server to expose specific methods that clients can call remotely. This is only used if the component is started as a service.
