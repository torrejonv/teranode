# 🔧 Technology Stack

## Go (1.24.5 or above)

Teranode is written in **Go**, leveraging its efficiency and simplicity to build scalable, concurrent microservices. **Go** was chosen for its high performance, especially when dealing with concurrent processes, which is crucial for handling the scale of blockchain validation and transaction processing within Teranode.

### Specific Usage in Teranode:

1. **Concurrency with Goroutines**: In Teranode, Go's goroutines are extensively used to manage concurrent processes like transaction validation and block propagation. This allows the system to handle multiple tasks simultaneously without compromising speed.

2. **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Go's memory management and garbage collection are vital for managing large amounts of data efficiently.

3. **Cross-Platform Compilation**: Since Teranode is designed to operate across various environments, Go's cross-platform capabilities ensure that binaries can be compiled for different systems seamlessly.

## gRPC

**gRPC** is employed in Teranode to enable efficient and fast communication between its various microservices. As Teranode is composed of multiple independent services (e.g., block validation, transaction propagation), gRPC ensures low-latency, high-throughput communication, which is essential for a system processing blockchain transactions in real-time.

### Specific Usage in Teranode:

1. **Service Definitions in Protobuf**: Teranode defines its RPC services using Protobuf files, which are compiled into Go code to generate gRPC stubs for the client and server.

2. **Bidirectional Streaming**: Certain operations in Teranode, such as transaction streaming or real-time blockchain updates, use gRPC's bidirectional streaming capabilities to maintain a continuous flow of data between nodes or services, enhancing performance.

## Protobuf

**Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)** is the serialization format used in Teranode to define the messages exchanged between services. This ensures that data (such as blocks, transactions, and validation results) is serialized in a compact binary format, minimizing the payload size for efficient communication.

### Specific Usage in Teranode:

1. **Data Serialization**: In Teranode, Protobuf is used to define the data structures for blockchain transactions, blocks, and validation requests. These definitions are stored in `.proto` files and compiled into Go, allowing the system to serialize and deserialize these structures efficiently.

2. **Backward Compatibility**: Teranode leverages Protobuf’s backward compatibility to evolve the blockchain system without breaking older services.

You can find more on Protobuf [here](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers).

## P2P Networking (libp2p)

**libp2p** is the modular peer-to-peer networking stack used in Teranode for node discovery and communication. It provides a robust foundation for building distributed systems with features like peer discovery, secure communication, and publish-subscribe messaging.

### Specific Usage in Teranode:

1. **Peer Discovery with Kademlia DHT**: Teranode uses Kademlia Distributed Hash Table for discovering and maintaining connections with other nodes in the network, ensuring a well-connected mesh topology.

2. **GossipSub for Message Broadcasting**: The GossipSub protocol is employed for efficient message propagation across the network, allowing nodes to broadcast blocks and transactions to multiple peers simultaneously.

3. **Persistent Peer Identity**: Each node maintains a persistent private key for its peer ID and encryption, ensuring consistent identity across restarts and secure communications.

4. **Future IPv6 Multicast Support**: While currently using libp2p, Teranode's architecture is designed to potentially benefit from IPv6 multicast in the future for even more efficient transaction dissemination, though this is currently limited by AWS platform constraints.

## Stores

Teranode employs various storage technologies, each selected for its specific strengths in terms of speed, scalability, and reliability. The choice of storage depends on the service's needs, such as real-time transaction processing, persistent blockchain storage, or temporary data caching.

### Specific Usage in Teranode:

1. **Aerospike**:
    - Teranode uses **Aerospike** as a distributed, high-performance NoSQL database for UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) storage
    - Provides fast, consistent reads and writes for transaction validation
    - Handles UTXO state management including spent/unspent/frozen states
    - Supports cleanup operations for transaction lifecycle management

2. **PostgreSQL**:
    - Used for blockchain metadata storage requiring complex queries
    - Stores block headers, chain state, and FSM (Finite State Machine) state
    - Provides SQL querying capabilities for blockchain analysis
    - Maintains block statistics and chain organization data

3. **Blob Storage**:
    - Multiple implementations for flexible deployment:
        - **S3**: AWS S3 for cloud-based blob storage
        - **File System**: Local file system for development/testing
        - **HTTP**: HTTP-based blob storage service
        - **Memory**: In-memory storage for caching and testing
    - Stores blocks, transactions, and Merkle subtrees
    - Supports concurrent access with batching capabilities

4. **Shared Storage**:
     - Enables services to share large datasets across multiple nodes
     - Used for block and transaction persistence in distributed deployments
     - Lustre file systems (provided via S3-backed shared volumes) offer high-throughput storage solution, and it is a recommended shared storage option

------


## Kafka

**Apache Kafka** is employed in Teranode for event-driven architectures, enabling real-time data pipelines. Kafka handles the ingestion and distribution of blockchain-related events, ensuring that all nodes are updated with the latest state of the network.

### Specific Usage in Teranode:

1. **Event Streaming**: Kafka is used to stream real-time events like transaction creation and block mining. These events are then consumed by different microservices to update the blockchain state or trigger validations.

2. **High Availability**: Kafka’s fault tolerance and replication ensure that event streams are durable and highly available, which is essential for the integrity of a distributed system like Teranode.

## Containerization & Orchestration

Teranode uses containerization as a crucial part of its deployment and scaling strategy, with **Docker** for packaging services and **Docker Compose** for local / test orchestration, while supporting **Kubernetes** for production deployments.

### Docker:
1. **Service Isolation**: Each microservice (validator, block assembly, blockchain, etc.) is packaged into its own Docker container, ensuring isolated runtime environments and easier management.

2. **Multi-stage Builds**: Uses optimized multi-stage Dockerfile with separate build and runtime images to minimize container size and improve security.

3. **Portability**: Docker ensures services run consistently across development, testing, and production environments.
