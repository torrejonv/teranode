## Overview

The RPC Service provides a JSON-RPC interface for interacting with the Bitcoin SV node. It handles various Bitcoin-related commands and manages client connections. The service implements a standard Bitcoin protocol interface while integrating with Teranode's modular architecture to provide high-performance access to blockchain data and network operations.

## Types

### RPCServer

```go
type RPCServer struct {
    // settings contains the configuration parameters for the RPC server including
    // authentication credentials, network binding options, and service parameters
    settings *settings.Settings

    // started indicates whether the server has been started (1) or not (0)
    // This uses atomic operations for thread-safe access

```

The RPCServer provides a concurrent-safe JSON-RPC server implementation for the Bitcoin protocol. It handles client authentication, request processing, response generation, and maintains connections to other Teranode services to fulfill RPC requests.

The server implements a two-tier authentication system that separates administrative capabilities from limited-user operations, providing security through proper authorization. It supports standard Bitcoin Core RPC methods and Bitcoin SV extensions for compatibility with existing tools while enhancing functionality.

The RPCServer is designed for concurrent operation, employing synchronization mechanisms to handle multiple simultaneous client connections without race conditions or resource conflicts. It implements proper connection management, graceful shutdown, and health monitoring.

## Functions

### NewServer

```go
func NewServer(logger ulogger.Logger, tSettings *settings.Settings, blockchainClient blockchain.ClientI, blockValidationClient blockvalidation.Interface, utxoStore utxo.Store, blockAssemblyClient blockassembly.ClientI, peerClient peer.ClientI, p2pClient p2p.ClientI, txStore blob.Store, validatorClient validator.Interface) (*RPCServer, error)
```

Creates a new instance of the RPC Service with the necessary dependencies including logger, settings, blockchain client, block validation client, UTXO store, transaction store, validator client, and service clients.

This factory function creates a fully configured RPCServer instance, setting up:

- Authentication credentials from settings
- Connection limits and parameters
- Command handlers and help text
- Client connections to required services

**Parameters:**

- `logger`: Structured logger for operational and debug messages
- `tSettings`: Configuration settings for the RPC server and related features
- `blockchainClient`: Interface to the blockchain service for block and chain operations
- `blockValidationClient`: Interface to the block validation service for block validation operations
- `utxoStore`: Interface to the UTXO database for transaction validation
- `blockAssemblyClient`: Interface to the block assembly service for mining operations
- `peerClient`: Interface to the legacy peer network services
- `p2pClient`: Interface to the P2P network services

The RPC server requires connections to several other Teranode services to function properly, as it primarily serves as an API gateway to underlying node functionality. These dependencies are injected through this constructor to maintain proper service separation and testability.

## Methods

### Start

```go
func (s *RPCServer) Start(ctx context.Context, readyCh chan<- struct{}) error
```

!!! info "Initialization Tasks"
    Starts the RPC server, begins listening for client connections, and signals readiness by closing the readyCh channel once initialization is complete.

    This method performs several critical initialization tasks:

    1. **Validates the server** has not already been started (using atomic operations)
    2. **Initializes network listeners** on all configured interfaces and ports
    3. **Launches goroutines** to accept and process incoming connections
    4. **Sets up proper handling** for clean shutdown
    5. **Signals readiness** through the provided channel

The server supports binding to multiple addresses simultaneously, allowing both IPv4 and IPv6 connections, as well as restricting access to localhost-only if configured for development or testing environments.

### Stop

```go
func (s *RPCServer) Stop(ctx context.Context) error
```

Gracefully stops the RPC server by:

1. **Setting shutdown flag** to prevent new connections
2. **Closing all active listeners** to stop accepting new requests
3. **Waiting for active connections** to complete their current operations
4. **Cleaning up resources** and releasing network ports

This method implements a thread-safe shutdown mechanism using atomic operations to prevent multiple concurrent shutdown attempts. When called, it closes the quit channel to signal all goroutines to terminate, then waits for them to exit using the wait group before returning.

### Init

```go
func (s *RPCServer) Init(ctx context.Context) (err error)
```

Performs second-stage initialization of the RPC server by establishing connections to dependent services that weren't available during initial construction.

!!! note "Initialization Steps"
    This method completes the RPC server initialization by:

    1. **Connecting to the Block Assembly service** for mining-related operations
    2. **Connecting to the P2P service** for network peer management
    3. **Connecting to the Legacy service** for compatibility with older protocols
    4. **Refreshing the help cache** with complete command information

The initialization is designed to be idempotent and can be safely called multiple times, though typically it's only called once after NewServer and before Start.

### Health

```go
func (s *RPCServer) Health(ctx context.Context, checkLiveness bool) (int, string, error)
```

Reports the operational status of the RPC service for monitoring and health checking.

This method implements the standard Teranode health checking interface used across all services for consistent monitoring, alerting, and orchestration.

!!! success "Health Check Types"
    It provides both readiness and liveness checking capabilities to support different operational scenarios:

    - **Readiness**: Indicates whether the service is ready to accept requests (listeners are bound and core dependencies are available)
    - **Liveness**: Indicates whether the service is functioning correctly (listeners are still working and not in a hung state)

**Health Check Components:**

- **Verifying network listeners** are active
- **Checking connections** to dependent services
- **Validating internal state** consistency

### checkAuth

```go
func (s *RPCServer) checkAuth(r *http.Request, require bool) (bool, bool, error)
```

Implements the two-tier HTTP Basic authentication system for RPC clients. It validates credentials supplied in the HTTP request against configured admin and limited-access username/password combinations.

!!! abstract "Authentication Flow"
    The method implements a secure authentication flow that:

    1. **Extracts the Authorization header** from the HTTP request
    2. **Validates the credentials** against both admin and limited-user authentication strings
    3. **Uses time-constant comparison** operations to prevent timing attacks
    4. **Distinguishes between admin users** (who can perform state-changing operations) and limited users (who can only perform read-only operations)

!!! warning "Security Considerations"

- **Uses SHA256** for credential hashing
- **Implements constant-time comparison** to prevent timing attacks
- **Properly handles missing** or malformed authentication headers
- **Can be configured** to require or not require authentication based on settings

**Returns:**

- `bool`: Authentication success (true if successful)
- `bool`: Authorization level (true for admin access, false for limited access). The value specifies whether the user can change the state of the node.
- `error`: Authentication error if any occurred, nil on success

### jsonRPCRead

```go
func (s *RPCServer) jsonRPCRead(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, isAdmin bool)
```

Handles reading and responding to RPC messages. This method is the core request processing function.

!!! gear "Request Processing Steps"
    1. **Parses incoming JSON-RPC requests** from HTTP request bodies
    2. **Validates request format** and structure
    3. **Routes requests** to appropriate command handlers
    4. **Formats and sends responses** back to clients
    5. **Implements proper error handling** and serialization
    6. **Ensures thread-safety** for concurrent request handling

The method supports batch requests, proper HTTP status codes, and includes safeguards against oversized or malformed requests. It also handles authorization checking to ensure admin-only commands cannot be executed by limited-access users.

## RPC Handlers

The RPC Service implements various handlers for Bitcoin-related commands. All handlers follow a consistent function signature:

```go
func handleCommand(ctx context.Context, s *RPCServer, cmd interface{}, closeChan <-chan struct{}) (interface{}, error)
```

Each handler receives a context for cancellation and tracing, the RPC server instance, parsed command parameters, and a close notification channel. They return a properly formatted response object or an error.

Some key handlers include:

- `handleGetBlock`: Retrieves block information at different verbosity levels
- `handleGetBlockHash`: Gets the hash of a block at a specific height
- `handleGetBestBlockHash`: Retrieves the hash of the best (most recent) block
- `handleCreateRawTransaction`: Creates a raw transaction
- `handleSendRawTransaction`: Broadcasts a raw transaction to the network
- `handleGetMiningCandidate`: Retrieves a candidate block for mining
- `handleSubmitMiningSolution`: Submits a solved block to the network
- `handleFreeze`: Freezes specified UTXOs to prevent spending
- `handleUnfreeze`: Unfreezes previously frozen UTXOs
- `handleReassign`: Reassigns specified frozen UTXOs to a new address
- `handleSetBan`: Adds or removes IP addresses/subnets from the node's ban list
- `handleClearBanned`: Removes all bans from the node
- `handleListBanned`: Lists all currently banned IP addresses and subnets

## Configuration

!!! settings "RPC Configuration Settings"
    The RPC Service uses various configuration values:

    **Authentication Settings:**

    - **`rpc_user` and `rpc_pass`**: Credentials for RPC authentication with full admin privileges
    - **`rpc_limit_user` and `rpc_limit_pass`**: Credentials for limited RPC access (read-only operations)

    **Connection Settings:**

    - **`rpc_max_clients`**: Maximum number of concurrent RPC clients (default: 1)
    - **`rpc_listener_url`**: URL for the RPC listener

    **Timeout Settings:**

    - **`rpc_timeout`**: Maximum time allowed for an RPC call to complete (default: 30s)
        - Prevents resource exhaustion from long-running operations
        - Returns error code -30 (ErrRPCTimeout) on timeout
    - **`rpc_client_call_timeout`**: Timeout for internal client calls to other services (default: 5s)
        - Used when RPC handlers call P2P, Legacy peer, or other internal services
        - Prevents hanging when dependent services are unresponsive

    **Performance Settings:**

    - **`rpc_cache_enabled`**: Enables RPC response caching (default: true)

    **Compatibility Settings:**

    - **`rpc_quirks`**: Enables compatibility quirks for legacy clients (default: true)

Configuration values can be provided through the configuration file, environment variables, or command-line flags, with precedence in that order.

## Authentication

!!! key "Authentication Levels"
    The server supports two levels of authentication:

    1. **Admin-level access** with full permissions
    2. **Limited access** with restricted permissions

Authentication is performed using HTTP Basic Auth.

**Credential Provision Methods:**

- **Username and password** in the HTTP header
- **Cookie-based authentication**
- **Configuration file settings**

### GRPC API Key Authentication

For GRPC services, certain administrative operations require additional API key authentication:

- **Protected Methods**: `BanPeer` and `UnbanPeer` operations in both P2P and Legacy GRPC services require API key authentication
- **Configuration**: Set via `grpc_admin_api_key` setting in the configuration file
- **Auto-generation**: If no API key is configured, the system generates a random 32-byte key at startup
- **Usage**: API key must be included in GRPC requests as metadata with the key `x-api-key`

!!! warning "Security Note"
    The API key provides administrative access to ban/unban operations. Ensure it is properly secured and not exposed in logs or configuration files in production environments.

## General Format

!!! info "Request Requirements"
    All requests should be POST requests with Content-Type: application/json.

**Request format:**

```json

## Error Handling

The RPC service uses a standardized error handling system based on the Bitcoin Core JSON-RPC error codes. All errors returned to clients follow the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification format:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "request-id",
  "error": {
    "code": -32000,
    "message": "Error message"
  }
}
```

Standard error codes include:

- -1: General error during command handling
- -3: Wallet error (wallet functionality not implemented)
- -5: Invalid address or key
- -8: Out of memory or other resource exhaustion
- -20: Database inconsistency or corruption
- -22: Error parsing or validating a block or transaction
- -25: Transaction or block validation error
- -26: Transaction rejected by policy rules
- -27: Transaction already in chain
- -30: RPC timeout - request exceeded configured timeout limit
- -32600: Invalid JSON-RPC request
- -32601: Method not found
- -32602: Invalid parameters
- -32603: Internal JSON-RPC error
- -32700: Parse error (invalid JSON)

Each handler implements specific error checks relevant to its operation and returns appropriately formatted error responses.

Errors are wrapped in `bsvjson.RPCError` structures, providing standardized error codes and messages as per the Bitcoin Core RPC specification.

RPC calls return errors in the following format:

```json
{
  "result": null,
  "error": {
    "code": -32601,
    "message": "Method not found"
  },
  "id": "id"
}
```

Common error codes that may be returned:

| Code    | Message                  | Meaning                                          |
|---------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| -1      | RPC_MISC_ERROR          | Standard "catch-all" error                       |
| -3      | RPC_TYPE_ERROR          | Unexpected type was passed as parameter          |
| -5      | RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS     | Invalid address or key                           |
| -8      | RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER   | Invalid, missing or duplicate parameter          |
| -32600  | RPC_INVALID_REQUEST     | JSON request format error                        |
| -32601  | RPC_METHOD_NOT_FOUND    | Method not found                                 |
| -32602  | RPC_INVALID_PARAMS      | Invalid method parameters                        |
| -32603  | RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR      | Internal RPC error                              |
| -32700  | RPC_PARSE_ERROR         | Error parsing JSON request                       |

## Rate Limiting

The RPC interface implements rate limiting to prevent abuse. Default limits:

- Maximum concurrent connections: 16
- Maximum requests per minute: 60

## Version Compatibility

These RPC commands are compatible with Bitcoin SV Teranode version 1.0.0 and later.

## Concurrency

The RPC Service is designed for high-concurrency operation with multiple simultaneous client connections. Key concurrency features include:

- Thread-safe request processing with proper synchronization
- Atomic operations for tracking client connections
- Connection limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- Wait groups for coordinated shutdown with in-progress requests
- Context-based cancellation for long-running operations
- Non-blocking request handler dispatch
- Proper mutex usage for shared data structures
- Per-request goroutines for parallel processing
- Response caching to reduce contention on frequently accessed data

These mechanisms ensure the RPC service can safely handle many concurrent connections without race conditions or deadlocks, even under high load scenarios.

The server uses goroutines to handle multiple client connections concurrently. It also employs various synchronization primitives (mutexes, atomic operations) to ensure thread-safety.

## Extensibility

The command handling system is designed to be extensible. New RPC commands can be added by implementing new handler functions and registering them in the `rpcHandlers` map.

## Limitations

- The server does not implement wallet functionality. Wallet-related commands are delegated to a separate wallet service.
- Several commands are marked as unimplemented and will return an error if called.
- The UTXO management commands (freeze, unfreeze, reassign) require the node to be properly configured with the necessary capabilities.
- Memory and connection limits are enforced to prevent resource exhaustion.

## Security

The RPC Service implements several security features:

- HTTP Basic authentication with SHA256 credential validation
- Two-tier authentication system separating admin from limited-access operations
- Connection limiting to prevent denial-of-service attacks
- Configurable binding to specific network interfaces
- Proper HTTP request/response handling with appropriate headers
- Input validation on all parameters
- Authorization checking for privileged operations
- Ban management capabilities for malicious IP addresses
- Context timeouts to prevent resource exhaustion
- Secure credential handling to prevent information leakage
- TLS support for encrypted communications (when configured)
