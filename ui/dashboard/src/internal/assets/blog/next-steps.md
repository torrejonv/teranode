## Successful test, next steps
> Teranode 2-week test completes successfully, what are the next steps?

We have completed our first 2-week test of Teranode, running sustained at over 1 million transactions per second.

Although we experienced some issues during the test, both with our infrastructure and in the software, in every instance we were able to recover and keep the chain going. This is a great achievement by the Teranode team and proves the scalability of the BSV Blockchain and the Bitcoin protocol.

During the 2-weeks the test was running, we gathered over 800TB of data; block data, subtree data, metrics and logs. Analysis of that data will be a big task, that will happen over the coming months, in parallel to completing the developments of Teranode itself.

But, it doesn't end there. Instead of running the test for a very long time, of which we are now confident we can do, we want to make it a bit harder and run the same test again, for 2 weeks, but this time with 6 nodes.

This will give us a good idea about the scalability of the network as a whole, next to the data we have already gathered about the scalability of the node.

The data on this site will be reset for this new test, but you should see our new nodes (M4, M5 and M6) pop up in the overviews and statistics.
